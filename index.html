            The author of this page is a former teacher. Safe-guarding advice for UK teacher-training is clear:
            Do not promise to keep a confidence that you might not be able to, but stress that you will not
            automatically inform a child's parent or guardian of anything, if it's not in the best interests
            of the child. The author considers it fortunate that they started teaching after the repeal of
	    <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/02/22/section-28-lgbtq-rights-stonewall/">Section 28</a>,
            which would have made it very difficult to intervene in homophobic bullying. Any requirement to
            notify parents of gender non-conforming behaviour is against best-practice, and a return to those
	    times. Following a leak that the UK Government does indeed intend to do this, there is a
            <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/636802">petition</a> to request that it doesn't. 
            As ever, the <a href="https://github.com/augeas/Transmedialint">UK media</a> is not helping,
            with easily de-bunked stories about pupils
	    <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2023/06/22/dead-cats-and-transphobic-lies/">"Identifing as cats, horses
            and dinosaurs",</a> rather like the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_boxes_in_schools_hoax">
            litter boxes</a> hoax.</p>

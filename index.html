                Following the <a href="https://transactual.org.uk/blog/2025/04/16/response-by-transactual-to-supreme-court-ruling-on-equality-act/">

                in signatures. The petitions run for 6 months, 100K signatures are required for a debate in Parliament, for whatever utility that may provide.
                Having signed them, consider <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/">writing to your MP</a>, as per the advice given by

            On the 4th of April 2023, the 
            
            <a href="https://transsafety.network/posts/institutional-capture/">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a> <a href="https://ruthpearce.net/2023/04/06/politicians-and-journalists-want-to-remove-trans-people-from-public-life-fuck-that/">recommended that
            the Equality Act</a> use the somewhat <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2020/06/15/the-myth-of-biological-sex/">vague and meaningless</a> term "biological sex" as a protected characteristic.
            In response, a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/627984">petition to not ammend the
            Equality Act</a> gained sufficient signatures for a debate in Parliament very rapidly, overtaking
            a contrary petition that had been growing gradually. Given the <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/06/lgbtq-people-vote-uk-general-election/">attitudes of the Government and Opposition</a>,
            it is arguable that this in itself will achieve very little, and having signed, one should <b>
            <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/">write to one's MP</a></b>.

How to use the WayBack Machine to scrape the growth in signatures for UK Parliament petitions.

If one has ever wondered about the dynamics of online petition signing, the
[WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) may be able to help, it has an
[API](https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/tree/master/wayback-cdx-server).

[Here's an example](https://github.com/augeas/UK-parliament-petition-scraper/blob/master/revoke_art_50.ipynb)
for the [Petition to Revoke Article 50](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584).

You can also play with a live notebook:
